<h1>About the Use of Python in Cmput 204</h1>
<p>
Python is a high level language that we will use to express algorithms in 
a short form, but one that can still be executed on a computer.
<p>
You need to learn enough about python to understand the algorithms in our examples, and understand
similar algorithms expressed either in Python,
or in pseudo code as in our textbook.
<p>
You are required to learn how to run a given python code, make
small modifications to it, and run it again.
<p>
I highly recommend that you work in-depth with the provided code
in order to learn more about how
the algorithms work.
<p>
In this course, you are not required to develop Python code ``from scratch''.

<h1>Python Resources</h1>
<p>
Most versions of Unix today come with Python pre-installed. For example, 
Linux (including the machines in our undergraduate labs)
and Mac OS X have it.

<p>
Note that your instructor and TAs do not provide support for the Python language
(beyond fixing our own sample codes if there is a bug).

<h2>Python Versions</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, there are two different Python dialects in current use, the 2.x line and the 3.x line. See
<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3">Python 2 vs 3</a>.
Many systems have both. For example, the Ubuntu 14.04 foundation system currently installed on the department's undergrad machines has both Python 2.7.6 (using the command python2) and Python 3.4.0 (named python3).
<p>
I will generally write Python 3.x code in this course. For the purposes of this course, any reasonable 3.x version should work.
If you need to run Python 2.x for some reason, you will need to adapt the sample codes. You can look at the 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html">main differences</a>.


<h2>Downloading Python</h2>
If you work with Python on the department's undergrad machines,
you do not need to install anything.
Just go to a command line prompt and type
<pre>
python3
</pre>
to start.

<p>
If your computer does not come with Python, you can find a download
at the Python Software Foundation's 
<a href="https://www.python.org">webpage</a>.
Pick the recommended 3.x version for your machine.
This website is also an excellent resource for all things Python,
such as tutorials for the language.
Also, you can search the internet for ``interactive python'' to get
many tutorials as well as sites that can directly run your Python code
in a web browser.

<p>
Mac users can check the
